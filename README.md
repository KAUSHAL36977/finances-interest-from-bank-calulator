# Interest Calculation and Indian Number Conversion

This project is a C++ program that calculates the interest on a given principal amount at a fixed interest rate (9% in this case) for both 1 year and 1 month. The program then converts the principal and calculated interest amounts into words using the Indian numbering system.

## Features

- **Principal Amount**: The user inputs the principal amount in numbers.
- **Interest Calculation**: The program calculates the interest for 1 year and 1 month based on a fixed interest rate of 9%.
- **Indian Number Conversion**: The principal and interest amounts are converted into words using the Indian numbering system (e.g., Lakhs, Crores).
- **Display**: The program outputs the amount in both numeric and word formats for the user.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interest-calculation-indian-words.git
   ```

2. Open the C++ file in your preferred C++ IDE or text editor.

3. Compile and run the program:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o interest-calculation
   ./interest-calculation
   ```

4. The program will prompt you to input the principal amount.

5. After entering the amount, it will display:
   - The principal amount in words.
   - The interest for 1 year in both numbers and words.
   - The interest for 1 month in both numbers and words.

## Example

**Input:**
```
Enter the principal amount: 123456789
```

**Output:**
```
The principal amount in words: Twelve Crore Three Lakh Forty Five Thousand Six Hundred Eighty Nine
Interest for 1 year: 11111111 (One Crore Eleven Lakh Eleven Thousand One Hundred Eleven)
Interest for 1 month: 925925.917 (Nine Lakh Twenty Five Thousand Nine Hundred Twenty Five)
```

## Code Explanation

- **convertToIndianWords Function**: This function converts a given integer into its corresponding word representation in the Indian numbering system (up to 1000 Crore).
  
- **Main Function**: 
  - It takes the principal amount as input.
  - Calculates the interest for 1 year and 1 month using the formula:  
    \[ \text{Interest} = \frac{{\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}}}{100} \]
  - Converts the interest and principal amounts into words using the `convertToIndianWords` function.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The program is written in C++.
- **Indian Numbering System**: The program uses the Indian numbering system (Lakh, Crore, etc.) to convert numbers into words.
